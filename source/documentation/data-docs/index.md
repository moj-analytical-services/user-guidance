# Data
#### There are several different data sources on the Analytical Platform:

* [Amazon S3](amazon-s3/)
* [Curated databases](curated-databases/)
* [Home directories](home-directories)

#### Getting the data you need

The data you need may already exist on the Analytical Platform. The diagram below shows the process for getting access to it. More details on each step is contained in the guidance. If after following this you find out the data you need is not on the Platform, you may need to find it and upload it yourself. In that case please refer to the [Information Governance](../information-governance.html) section.
