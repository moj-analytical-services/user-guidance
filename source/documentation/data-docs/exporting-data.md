# Exporting data to other platforms

You may want to send work you've done on the Analytical Platform to another Ministry of Justice digital platform. For example, you might need to regularly send data to the HMPPS Performance Hub or to a web app on Cloud Platform. 

If the destination platform uses Amazon Web Services, we can automate this sort of transfer. Ask the data engineering team on the [#ask-data-engineering Slack channel](https://asdslack.slack.com/archives/C8X3PP1TN). You're responsible for making sure this is permitted in your data protection impact assessment, and for arranging permission to move the data. 

If you're not sure if the destination platform uses Amazon Web Services, ask one of the developers of the service you're trying to send data to.

If the destination uses another cloud provider (such as Microsoft Azure), a transfer might still be possible, but it will be harder. Still [ask the data engineering team](https://asdslack.slack.com/archives/C8X3PP1TN), so we know about the need, but be warned that we might not be able to prioritise the work.
