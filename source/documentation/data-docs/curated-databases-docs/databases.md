# Databases

The data engineering team curate and maintain databases on the Analytical Platform that can be made accessible to users. All of our databases are currently deployed and accessible using Amazon Athena. We currently support users being able to query these databases via the [Athena SQL workbench](#amazon-athena), [R and Python](#dbtools).

To see what databases are available and how to request access, see the [README](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/data-engineering-infrastructure/blob/master/README.md) in the [data-engineering-infrastructure](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/data-engineering-infrastructure) repository on GitHub.

> Note, you must be a member of the [moj-analytical-services](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services) GitHub organisation to access the repository.

To find out about the metadata of the curated databases (without making a database access request), you can use the [metadata search tool](#metadata-search-tool).
