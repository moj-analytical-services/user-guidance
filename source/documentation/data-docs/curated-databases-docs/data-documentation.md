# Data Discovery and Documentation

Documentation on curated databases is contained in the [data discovery tool](https://data-discovery-tool.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/). Access to the tool is now governed via GitHub; Analytical Platform users have access by default.

Basic metadata is provided automatically by data engineers. Documentation is provided by users, so please do add what you know! Instructions on how to add your material are contained within in the app.
