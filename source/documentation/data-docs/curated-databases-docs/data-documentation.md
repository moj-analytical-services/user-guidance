# Data Discovery and Documentation

Documentation on curated databases is contained in [https://data-discovery-tool.apps.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz](https://data-discovery-tool.apps.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz). To access the tool, you must sign in using an email link. Many users will have had their justice emails automatically added to the allow list. If you enter your email and are denied access, you can request to be added in  `#data_engineers` in DASD slack.

Basic metadata is provided automatically by data engineers. Documentation is provided by users, so please do add what you know! Instructions on how to add your material are contained within in the app.
