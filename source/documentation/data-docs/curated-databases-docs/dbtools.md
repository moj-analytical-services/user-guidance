# dbtools

The Data Engineering Team have developed some simple packages to allow you to query our databases using R and Python on the Analytical Platform. `pydbtools` is a python module, while `dbtools` is an R package that uses `pydbtools` under the hood. You can use these packages to execute SQL queries on Athena databases, bringing the results into your environment as a DataFrame to do further analysis.
