# Home directories

Home directories have two purposes:

* storing config files that are needed to allow you to use the AP
* storing local copies of code and analytical outputs while you are working on them

Analysts are expected to keep their home directories clean and clear, and avoid storing large amounts of data there. Any files stored in home directories may be removed without warning by the AP admin team in order to maintain the functioning of the AP.

In addition, we will periodically review home storage and may remove files from users with the largest storage without warning.
