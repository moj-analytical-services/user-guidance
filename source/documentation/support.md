# Support

The Analytical Platform team provides support for problems with the platform. This does not include third-party tools and software you can access through the Analytical Platform such as GitHub. You can [see our shared responsibility model](/./shared-responsibility-model.html) for more information about what the Analytical Platform team can help with. 

Before you ask for support, make sure you’ve tried the following steps. 

## Check for a known fix to your problem 
First, you should see if your problem is listed in our [common errors and solutions](/./errors.html). If you cannot find it, then search online for your problem or error message if you have one. We also recommend searching for your problem on Slack using relevant keywords. 

## Troubleshoot your problem
If you cannot find a fix for your problem or do not know where the problem is, you should identify which area or component is not working. Follow instructions on [producing a minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to try and find the problem.      

## Raise an issue
If you still need help, [select your problem on our GitHub form](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform-support/issues/new/choose) to find the right support. 

If you’re not a DOM1 user or cannot access GitHub, [send us an email](analytical-platform@digital.justice.gov.uk).
