# Support

The Analytical Platform team provides and maintains the platform and its tools, but users are responsible for their own code and resolving application-level problems. 

If you do not know whether the problem is in your code, follow the steps in ['Before you raise an issue'](#before-you-raise-an-issue) first or speak to a lead in your area. 

## Get support from the Analytical Platform team

The Analytical Platform team does not provide support for user problems, including:

* debugging application logs or errors in your code
* dependency management or package upgrades
* maintaining your Dockerfile or build errors 
* fixing deployment failures from application errors
* managing your cloud platform environments 

You can [see our shared responsibility model](/./shared-responsibility-model.html) for more information about what the Analytical Platform team can help with. 

### Before you raise an issue
Before you contact the Analytical Platform team, make sure you’ve followed the steps in this section to rule out a known problem or check whether the error is in your code.

1. Check if there's a current incident. <br><br> Go to the [Analytical Platform's status page](https://status.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk) and check if there's an incident affecting the tool or service you're experience a problem with. 

1. Check for a known fix to your problem. <br><br> You should see if your problem is listed in our [common errors and solutions page](/./errors.html). If you cannot find it, then search online for your problem or error message if you have one. We also recommend searching for your problem on Slack using relevant keywords. 

1. Troubleshoot your problem. <br><br> If you cannot find a fix for your problem or do not know where the problem is, you should identify which area or component is not working. Follow instructions on [producing a minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to try and find the problem.      

### Raise an issue
If you still need help with a platform problem, [select your problem on our GitHub form](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform-support/issues/new/choose) to find the right support.  

If you’re not a DOM1 user or cannot access GitHub, [send us an email](analytical-platform@digital.justice.gov.uk). 

## Incident management

The Analytical Platform team follows an incident management process to investigate and resolve problems affecting the platform's availability and functionality. 

You can find up to date information about incidents on the [Analytical Platform's status page](https://status.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov) and the team's [#ask-analytical-platform channel on Slack](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C4PF7QAJZ).  

### Response and resolution times 

The Analytical Platform team cannot guarantee response or resolution times, nor out of hours support. The team will do their best to investigate and resolve incidents according to capacity and the priority levels defined in the Analytical Platform's incident management process.
