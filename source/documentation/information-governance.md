# Information governance

## Working with personal data

If you are working with personal data you have a responsibility to ensure that you comply with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018.

### What is personal data?

Personal data includes information relating to a living individual who can be:

*   directly identified from the information
*   indirectly identified from the information in combination with other information

Personal data could include information such as:

*   names
*   personal identifiers
*   dates of birth
*   addresses

You can find detailed guidance from the ICO on determining what constitutes personal data [here](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/what-is-personal-data/).

### Principles of the GDPR

The GDPR has seven key principles:

*   lawfulness, fairness and transparency
*   purpose limitation
*   data minimisation
*   accuracy
*   storage limitation
*   integrity and confidentiality
*   accountability

#### Lawfulness, fairness and transparency

>   *   You must identify valid grounds under the GDPR (known as a ‘lawful basis’) for collecting and using personal data.
>   *   You must ensure that you do not do anything with the data in breach of any other laws.
>   *   You must use personal data in a way that is fair. This means you must not process the data in a way that is unduly detrimental, unexpected or misleading to the individuals concerned.
>   *   You must be clear, open and honest with people from the start about how you will use their personal data.
>

#### Purpose limitation

>   *   You must be clear about what your purposes for processing are from the start.
>   *   You need to record your purposes as part of your documentation obligations and specify them in your privacy information for individuals.
>   *   You can only use the personal data for a new purpose if either this is compatible with your original purpose, you get consent, or you have a clear basis in law.

#### Data minimisation

>   You must ensure the personal data you are processing is:
>   
>   *   adequate
>   *   relevant
>   *   limited to what is necessary
>
>   Source: [ICO](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/data-minimisation/)

In practice, you may want to consider whether a subset of a larger data set (removing irrelevant fields or observations) or an aggregated data set would be sufficient for your work.

It is good practice to undertake data minimisation in general when moving data to the Analytical Platform due to memory limits.

#### Accuracy

>   *   You should take all reasonable steps to ensure the personal data you hold is not incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact.
>   *   You may need to keep the personal data updated, although this will depend on what you are using it for.
>   *   If you discover that personal data is incorrect or misleading, you must take reasonable steps to correct or erase it as soon as possible.
>   *   You must carefully consider any challenges to the accuracy of personal data.
>

#### Storage limitation

>   *   You must not keep personal data for longer than you need it.
>   *   You need to think about -- and be able to justify -- how long you keep personal data. This will depend on your purposes for holding the data.
>   *   You need a policy setting standard retention periods wherever possible, to comply with documentation requirements.
>   *   You should also periodically review the data you hold, and erase or anonymise it when you no longer need it.
>   *   You must carefully consider any challenges to your retention of data. Individuals have a right to erasure if you no longer need the data.
>   *   You can keep personal data for longer if you are only keeping it for public interest archiving, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes.

#### Integrity and confidentiality

>   You must ensure that you have appropriate security measures in place to protect the personal data you hold.

#### Accountability

>   You must have appropriate measures and records in place to be able to demonstrate your compliance.

>   Source: [ICO](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/accountability-principle/)

One way of ensuring accountability is by carrying out [data protection impact assessments](#data-protection-impact-assessments).

You can find more detailed information and guidance on the scope, meaning and application of these principles in the ICO's [Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/).

### Data protection impact assessments

> A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a process to help you identify and minimise the data protection risks of a project.
>
> Source: [ICO](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments/)

When starting any project that involves the processing of personal data, you should complete a [DPIA screening document](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/documents/2018/05/data-protection-impact-assessments-screening-template.doc) and submit this to the MoJ data compliance team ([data.compliance@justice.gov.uk](mailto:data.compliance@justice.gov.uk)). The MoJ data compliance team will provide feedback on the document and let you know if you need to complete a full DPIA within three working days.

You may have to complete and submit a DPIA differently depending on which organisation owns the data:

* [MoJ HQ]()
* [OPG]()
* [HMPPS]()
* [HMCTS]()
* [LAA]()

### Privacy notices

### Best practice guidelines

All users should comply with the following best practice guidelines for retaining personal data.

__All users will:__

*   be aware when they are working with [personal data](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/what-is-personal-data/)
*   consider and justify why personal data needs to be retained and for how long
*   identify when personal data needs to be kept for public interest archiving, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes
*   review the need to retain personal data on a regular basis
*   erase or anonymise personal data when it is no longer required
*   erase data as required in accordance with an individual's 'right to be forgotten' under the Data Protection Act 2018

The relevant information asset owner (IAO) should be able to advise if any additional data retention policies or requirements apply.

## Data movements

All data movements should take place safely and securely to ensure that data is protected at all times, including when in transit. To facilitate this, when moving any data onto the Analytical Platform, you must complete a data movement form. 

<a class="govuk-button" role="button" draggable="false" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=KEeHxuZx_kGp4S6MNndq2I8ebMaq5PFBoMAkkhrMYHBUQVY2VUczTUNPUzlZQTJTNjFWVUowWUxUMS4u" data-module="govuk-button">
  Complete a data movement form
</a>

Depending on the details of the data movement, you may also be required to complete or update:

* A technical migration form
* [Data protection impact assessments](#data-protection-impact-assessments)
* Privacy impact assessments
* [Privacy notices](#privacy-notices)
* Information management and asset logs

Before completing a data movement form, you should ensure that you have already obtained all necessary approvals and completed all required supplementary documentation.

  Further information on data privacy and privacy notices within MoJ can be found [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/protecting-information/privacy-reform/). ICO guidance can also be found [here](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-be-informed/).

#### The data movement

* __Why is the data being moved?__
* __What is the source of the data?__
* __Where will the data be stored on the Analytical Platform?__
* __Which S3 bucket will the data be stored in?__
* __How many records does the data contain?__
* __Who will have access to the data on the Analytical Platform?__
* __How will the data be moved?__  
  Describe how the data will be moved from the source location. Will the data be moved electronically, by email or by physical media? Will it be uploaded manually to S3 or a home directory or will there be a direct integration with another system?
* __Is a technical migration form required?__  
  A technical migration form is not required for one-off data movements of static files (such as ZIP files and CSV files) that are carried out manually (i.e. by email or direct upload to S3 or a home directory). A technical migration form is required for all other data movements.  
  If you are unsure whether your data movement requires a technical migration form, please email [analytical_platform@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:analytical_platform@digital.justice.gov.uk). A template technical migration form can be found [here](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/AnalyticalPlatform/EafJPVHk2NRCjZm1WGFPOJcBpkJ-pH8L2o0hKma2bsbWow?e=0pWGjc).
