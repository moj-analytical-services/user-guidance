# Manage access to an app

To manage the users of your app:

1.  Go to the Analytical Platform [control panel](https://controlpanel.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz).
2.  Select the __Webapps__ tab.
3.  Select the name of the app you want to manage or select __Manage app__.

To add app users:

1.  Enter the email addresses of the users in the box titled 'Add app customers by entering their email addresses' -- multiple email addresses can be separated by spaces, tabs, commas and semicolons.
2.  Select __Add customer__.

To remove an app user, select __Remove customer__ next to the email address of the customer you want to remove.

You can also ask the Analytical Platform team to add or remove users to the access list on the [#ap_admin_request](https://asdslack.slack.com/messages/CBLAGCQG6/) Slack channel or by email ([analytical_platform@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:analytical_platform@digital.justice.gov.uk)).
