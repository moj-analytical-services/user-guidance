# Contribute

We welcome contributions to our documentation from the Analytical Platform user community. If you see anything on this website that is inaccurate, or have a new piece of content in mind, we invite you to collaborate with us. Your input helps us ensure we are meeting our users' needs.

After you complete the [Quickstart guide][quickstart.md], you can contribute to the Analytical Platform guidance. Before making any changes, contact support to discuss the content you are proposing using the **#analytical-platform-support** Slack channel on the **Justice Digital workspace**. We will assign someone to review your content before publishing it.

>**Note:** Make sure your changes are on a branch. **Do not** edit the main branch. 

When writing content, consider the knowledge and requirements of who you are writing for. Following the [GDS style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style) helps ensure you are meeting our writing standards and users' needs, and reduces the number of edits you will need to make before we publish your content.
