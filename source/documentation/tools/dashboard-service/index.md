# Dashboard Service 

The [Dashboard Service](https://dashboards.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/dashboards/) allows users to securely share and view dashboards created in QuickSight. 
 
## Share a dashboard 

Follow the steps below to share a dashboard. You can only share a dashboard if you have admin rights, which you'll automatically have for any dashboard you created.  

1. Select **QuickSight** from the Analytical Platform Control Panel’s navigation bar. 

1. Select **Share dashboards** from the sub-navigation bar. 

1. Under **Choose dashboard**, select your dashboard from the dropdown menu. You can also use autocomplete if you start typing your dashboard name.  

1. Under **Enter a description**, describe your dashboard to help others understand what it shows. Explain any acronyms or less common terms. 

1. Next, decide whether you need to share your dashboard with specific email addresses or by allowing all users on an email domain to view your dashboard.  
 

    > 

    > Do not add domain access for dashboards containing sensitive data. 

    > 

1. Add email addresses under **Add an email** or select a domain under **Add domain access**, then select **Next**. 

1. Check the details you’ve entered on the next screen and make sure **Dashboard preview** shows the correct dashboard. 

1. Select **Share dashboard** and you’ll see a success banner with a link to manage your dashboard’s sharing settings. 

 
## View dashboards shared with you 
 
You can view all dashboards shared with you on the [Analytical Platform Dashboards page](https://dashboards.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/dashboards/" target="_blank).   

 
If you work for the Ministry of Justice, log in using the **Continue with Microsoft Entra ID** button. You can log in to the Dashboard Service even if a dashboard has not been shared with you. 

 
If you do not work for the Ministry of Justice, you can only log in after a dashboard has been shared with you. You’ll need to enter your email address, then check your email for a one-time code you can use to authenticate your account.
