# Sharing your QuickSight dashboards 

The Analytical Platform allows you to securely share dashboards with users at the Ministry of Justice and other relevant organisations. 

You can [share a dashboard](https://dashboards.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/dashboards/) created in QuickSight by adding individuals with their email address or by adding domain level access. You'll need admin rights to share a dashboard, which you'll automatically have for any dashboard you created. 

> 
> Do not add domain access for dashboards containing sensitive data. 
>

You can manage your dashboard to:
* add viewer or admin permissions
* remove viewer or admin permissions 
* add user or domain access
* remove user or domain access
