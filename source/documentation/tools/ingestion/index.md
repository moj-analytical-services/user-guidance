# Ingestion

> Ingestion on the Analytical Platform is currently a beta service.

## Service Requirements

###Â Required Information

To use the Ingestion service, data owners must provide the following information:

- Supplier's name
- Supplier's email
- Supplier's IP address(es)
- Supplier's SSH public key
- Target location on Analytical Platform (e.g. `s3://${TARGET_BUCKET}/${OPTIONAL_PREFIX}`)

Please raise a support ticket [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform-support/issues/new?template=analytical-platform-ingestion.yml) with the required information to start the onboarding process.

> **Note**: The Supplier's name you provide us will become your USERNAME.

### Optional Information

- Slack channel

## Target Bucket Setup and Responsibilities

The Target Bucket is defined as the S3 bucket which files should arrive in. These buckets can be in any AWS Account, there are two distinct scenarios however: 

- A bucket in `analytical-platform-data-prodcution`
- A bucket not in `analytical-platform-data-prodcution`

Ministry of Justice colleagues are expected to raise the appropriate Pull Requests to enable the transfer to succeed. Third party consumers can request help in doing this in our ask channel [#ask-analytical-platform](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C4PF7QAJZ).

### Configuring Destination Bucket Permissions

The destination S3 bucket must have the correct permisssions to allow the final `transfer` Lambda function to copy files to it. 

For a given S3 bucket `<destination-bucket-name>` include the following statement:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        ...
        {
            "Sid": "AllowAnalyticalPlatformIngestionService",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<ingestion-account-ID>:role/transfer"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectAcl",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                "s3:PutObjectTagging"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<destination-bucket-name>",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<destination-bucket-name>/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The `ingestion-account-ID` should be `471112983409` when connections are being made by the `transfer` lambda function in `analytical-platform-ingestion-production` and `730335344807` when connections are being made from `analytical-platform-ingestion-development`.
