# Visual Studio Code

> Visual Studio Code on the Analytical Platform is currently a beta feature.

## Packaged Tools

* [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/)

* [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html)

* [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

* [Ollama](/tools/visual-studio-code/ollama)

## Known Issues

* Like JupyterLab and RStudio, Visual Studio Code runs on Analytical Platform's Kubernetes infrastructure, therefore we cannot provide access to Docker.

* [Visual Studio Code's port forwarding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/port-forwarding) functionality doesn't work.
