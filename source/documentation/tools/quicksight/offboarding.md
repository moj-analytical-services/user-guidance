- Enter the email of the colleague you wish to transfer ownership to in the textbox under Invite users and groups to dashboard.
- Click the add button and select co-owner.

## Transferring analyses

To tranfer an analysis:

- Go to the [QuickSight UI within Control Panel].
- Click on the analyses tab and select the analysis you wish to transfer.
- Click file on the top left of the screen.
- Click Share.
- Enter the email of the colleague you wish to transfer ownership to in the textbox.
- Select the user. Ensure Co-owner is selected under Permission.
- Click the Share button.

## Transferring datasets

To tranfer a dataset:

- Go to the [QuickSight UI within Control Panel].
- Click on the datasets tab.
- Click the three dots on the right side of the dataset you wish to transfer.
- Click Manage permissions.
- Click the Invite users button.
- Enter the email of the colleague you wish to transfer ownership to in the textbox.
- Select the user. Ensure Owner is selected under Permission.
