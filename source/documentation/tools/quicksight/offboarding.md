# Offboarding from QuickSight

If you're leaving the organisation, you are responsible for transferring all assets (such as dashboards, analyses and datasets) to a colleague. This prevents these assets becoming orphaned or lost.

## Transferring dashboards

To transfer a dashboard:

1. Go to the [QuickSight UI within Control Panel].
1. Select the **Dashboards** tab, then select the dashboard you want to transfer.
1. Select the share icon on the top right of the screen.
1. Select **Share dashboard**.
1. Enter the email of the colleague you want to transfer ownership to in the textbox under **Invite users and groups to dashboard**.
1. Select **Add** and then select **Co-owner**.

## Transferring analyses

To transfer an analysis:

- Go to the [QuickSight UI within Control Panel].
- Select the **Analyses** tab, then select the analysis you want to transfer.
- Select **File** on the top left of the screen.
- Select **Share**.
- Enter the email of the colleague you want to transfer ownership to in the textbox.
- Select the user. Make sure **Co-owner** is selected under **Permission**.
- Select **Share**.

## Transferring datasets

To transfer a dataset:

- Go to the [QuickSight UI within Control Panel].
- Select the **Datasets** tab.
- Select the three dots on the right side of the dataset you want to transfer.
- Select **Manage permissions**.
- Select **Invite users**.
- Enter the email of the colleague you want to transfer ownership to in the textbox.
- Select the user. Make sure **Owner** is selected under **Permission**.
- Select **Share**.

After you've transferred your assets, remove your QuickSight access and permissions:
1. Go to your [user page in the Control Panel].
1. Remove QuickSight access by unticking all permissions under **QuickSight access** .
1. Select **Save changes**.
