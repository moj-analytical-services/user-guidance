# Using QuickSight to visualise your data

⚠️ This service is in beta ⚠️

AWS QuickSight is a cloud-powered business intelligence (BI) tool that makes it easy to create and share interactive dashboards and visualisations from data available to the Analytical Platform.

We’re still early in our implementation and we'd love to get some of you using QuickSight to [get your feedback] to help guide best practices for data visualization in the Ministry of Justice and make sure we can continue to improve the user experience.

## Overview

### What data is in QuickSight?

If you're using QuickSight on the Analytical Platform, you can only use data published through [Create a Derived Table](/tools/create-a-derived-table).

We currently have each of the [domains/business areas](/tools/create-a-derived-table/project-structure/#domains) within '[mojap-derived-tables]' on QuickSight.
