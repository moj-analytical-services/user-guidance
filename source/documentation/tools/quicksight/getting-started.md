# Getting Started

## Prerequisites to using QuickSight in Analytical Platform

- [ ] Permission to read datasets available in QuickSight
- [ ] QuickSight enabled for your user within Analytical Platform Control Panel

### Permissions

You'll need permissions to databases, tables, or domains for datasets produced by Create a Derived Table. These permissions are defined in the data-engineering-database-access repo

> **Q:** How do I know if I should be able to see a particular table/database/domain in QuickSight?  

> **A:** See [What data is on quicksight?](/tools/quicksight/what-data-is-in-quicksight) - TL;DR: databases in the repo that have paths beginning with mojap-derived-tables/prod/models/ in their definitions. (example)
