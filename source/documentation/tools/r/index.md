# R

R is a powerful statistical programming language and software environment commonly used for data analysis, visualization, and computational statistics.

You can write and run R code in one of the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tools on the Analytical Platform:

* [RStudio](https://user-guidance.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/tools/ides/rstudio/index.html): a IDE built specifically for R
* [Visual Studio Code](https://user-guidance.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/tools/ides/visual-studio-code/index.html): a multi-purpose IDE for running code including R scripts
