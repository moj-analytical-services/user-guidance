# Create a Derived Table

This service lets you use SQL to transform raw data into persistent derived tables. Using a tool called dbt, you can make consistent, reproducible tables without touching R or Python, and have them regularly updated without touching Airflow. You can also test your transformations and break down complex SQL into reusable modular queries.

We're in the early stages of developing the service. Visit the [Create a Derived Table repo](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/create-a-derived-table) to see progress, or ask us about testing on the [#ask-data-modelling](https://asdslack.slack.com/archives/C03J21VFHQ9) Slack channel.
