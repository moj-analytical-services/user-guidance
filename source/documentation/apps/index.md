# Apps

Once you've built your app, you can make it available to users through the Analytical Platform.
We have guidance for Shiny apps and static apps:

- Deploying your app
- Accessing your deployed app
- Managing your app users
- Managing and Monitoring Deployments

as well as common issues faced during these stages of publishing your app.

> It is not currently possible to deploy new apps on the Analytical Platform, though we are working to make this functionality available again as soon as possible.

> In the meantime, you can still [access](#access-the-app) and [manage](#manage-app-users) existing apps.

> If you have an existing app that requires urgent redeployment, please submit a [request](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/analytical-platform-applications/issues/new?assignees=EO510%2C+YvanMOJdigital&labels=redeploy&template=redeploy-app-request.md&title=%5BREDEPLOY%5D) via GitHub. We normally redeploy apps each Wednesday, where we have recevied a request by the Friday before.
