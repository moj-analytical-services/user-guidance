# Apps

It is not currently possible to deploy new apps on the Analytical Platform, though we are working to make this functionality available again as soon as possible.

In the meantime, you can still access and manage existing apps.

If you have an existing app that requires urgent redeployment, please submit a [request](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/analytical-platform-applications/issues/new?assignees=EO510%2C+YvanMOJdigital&labels=redeploy&template=redeploy-app-request.md&title=%5BREDEPLOY%5D) via GitHub. We normally redeploy apps each Wednesday, where we have recevied a request by the Friday before.
