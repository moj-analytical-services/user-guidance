Once you've built your app, you can make it available to users through the Analytical Platform.
We have guidance for Shiny apps and static apps:

- Deploying your app
- Accessing your deployed app
- Managing your app users
- Managing and Monitoring Deployments

as well as common issues faced during these stages of publishing your app.
