# MoJ Analytical Platform

This guidance provides information on how to use the Ministry of Justice's Analytical Platform.

## What is the Analytical Platform?

> The Analytical Platform is a data analysis environment, providing modern tools and key datasets for MoJ analysts

It offers:

* modern data tools and services
* centralised data
* reproducible analysis
* secure and well-engineered environment

See [about the Analytical Platform](/about.html).

## Why use the Analytical Platform

* The Analytical Platform aids reproducibility through versioned data and code. Reproducibility is the foundation of good analysis, allowing for future auditing of work and robust Quality Assurance ([Best Practice & Impact division, Office for National Statistics](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/principles.html)). Therefore, if work has an impact significant enough to require detailed Quality Assurance, the Analytical Platform should be used.
* The Analytical Platform is able to handle considerably more data than legacy analytical applications, and analysis can be run quickly. Therefore, if work requires a large dataset, or calculations are complex, the Analytical Platform should be used.
* The Analytical Platform uses GitHub, which allows multiple analysts to collaborate on the same bit of code simultaneously, separating code in development from code that has been reviewed/QAd. Therefore if multiple analysts are working on the same project, then the Analytical Platform should be used.
