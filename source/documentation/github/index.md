# Git and GitHub

### What is git?

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system. It allows you to track changes in files and directories, and to collaborate with others on code development.

### What is GitHub?

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a online hosting platform for git. It also provides a wide range of other [developer tools](https://github.com/features), covering:

- automation
- security
- project management
- package and website hosting

You can read more about the [benefits of GitHub](../annexes.html#benefits-of-using-github) and why we use it.

All code written on the Analytical Platform should be stored in a [git repository](create-project.html) on GitHub in the [MoJ Analytical Services](organisation-management.html) organisation. This includes R scripts, Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

### Join GitHub

If you do not have a GitHub account, you will be prompted to create one when you join the moj-analytical-services or ministryofjustice GitHub Organisations via SSO. [Click here](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/sso) to join the ministryofjustice Organisation. [Click here](https://github.com/orgs/moj-analytical-services/sso) to join the moj-analytical-services Organisation. If you experience any issues with the SSO process please contact [#ask-operations-engineering](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01BUKJSZD4)

### Get started

If you're new to git or GitHub, you may find it useful to take a look at the [learning resources](learning-resources.html) before getting started.

When you're ready, you'll need to [set up GitHub](set-up-github.html) to work with git in RStudio and JupyterLab on the Analytical Platform.
